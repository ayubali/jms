e. First of all make sure that the Glassfish server is running and the ConnectionFactory and Resource are created. For that you can open the asadmin console and type in the list-jms-resources command to see the JMS resources on your Glassfish installation. This is already described above.

In order to run the client successfully you need a few jar files on your classpath.

From your Glassfish lib folder:

gf-client.jar
javaee.jar
From your Glassfish modules folder:
javax.jms.jar
And these files are in imqjmsra.rar archive that you can find in your glassfish\mq\lib directory. You need to manually extract all of these jar files from imqjmsra.rar and place them in the classpath of your JMS Client.
fscontext.jar
imqbroker.jar
imqjmsbridge.jar
imqjmsra.jar
imqjmx.jar
imqstomp.jar
Once you have your classpath setup and the Glassfish is up and running then you can run the client to see the JMS communication in action. Here is the output when I run the client on my machine.
